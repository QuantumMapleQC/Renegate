        <p>Yeah, so Renegade is an open-source platform built with Python. Right now, I’m the main developer behind the website and all that jazz. It's been a fun journey so far, but the best part is that it’s open-source, so anyone can pitch in and help shape it into something even bigger. It’s all about giving creators the freedom to do their thing and build something amazing together!</p>

        <p>Join the Renegade revolution and experience a new way of connecting, creating, and collaborating. Whether you're a creator, developer, or community member, there's a place for you here. Help shape the future of Renegade – the app that’s built by the people, for the people!</p>

        <p>Ready to be a part of it? Dive in and see where your creativity takes you!</p>
